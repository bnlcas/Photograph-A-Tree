        <h1>Photograph a Tree</h1>
        <p>
            Watching a tree is a great thing to do. A tree is probably the most knowledgable living being about the small space where it lives. It stands there day in, day out, rain or shine living its life. It needs to know where the sun shines, how the wind blows and where the water flows. It needs to understand how the seasons turn from Spring to Summer to Fall to Winter. In order to thrive, a tree needs to know how to cope with every single element and living thing in its immediate proximity.

        <p> Naturally you can learn a lot about your home just by observing the nearby trees. But trees are slow. They grow and change over the course weeks, months and years. They gradually adapt themselves to their environment as best they can. If you want to observe a tree on its own time scale, you would need to speed up your perception of time. Fortunately you can do this with a  smartphone camera, some software and some persistence.

        <h2>Step 1: Pick a Tree</h2>
        <p>
            Any tree will do, but some are easier to observe than others. Hopefully choose a tree that you pass by on most days. Maybe choose one that is close to your home or close to your school or your work. Try to choose a tree that you can reliably visit without too much    trouble.

        <h2>Step 2: Pick a Vantage Point</h2>
        <p>
            Find a spot to observe the tree. You will need to go to this spot every day so ideally this spot should be easy to find. Maybe pick a  spot next to a rock, or by a street pole, or even by another tree. For the video above, I used a lamp post just off the path. Be sure that your spot will give you a clear view of the whole tree where you can fit the  whole tree in the frame of your camera. You could try to get creative and try move around each day but I think you will find that a single spot is going to be     the easiest.

        <h2>Step 3: Photograph your tree</h2>
        <p>
            Try to pass by your tree with every day to photograph it. Ideally you would try visit your tree at a specific time of time day so the lighting doesn't change too much. When photograph your tree try to line up your shot so that the tree is always in the same place. There are a few ways you might do this. You might try to get the top of the tree to be at the top and middle of the frame. Or you might try to get the bottom of the tree lined up with the bottom third of the frame.

        <p>
            On an iPhone you can add a grid overlay to your camera's preview by going to Settings > Camera > "Turn on Grid". This may help you line up your shots against the reference lines.

        <h2>Making a Timelapse Video of your Tree</h2>
        <p>
            After a month (or longer) collect all of your photographs of the tree.
            There are a lot of tools that will help you convert these photos into a video or an animation. This will let you see how your tree has changed over the season. I put together a simple tool to help with this <a href="./image2video.html">right here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Appreciate your Tree</h2>
        <p>
            That's all there is to it. You can now look at how your tree has changed from day to day over the past weeks. Hopefully you will notice how it changes from day to day. How the leaves move, and the branches change with the temperature and the humidity. Maybe you will be curious to see how this tree changes over the next season. You could even start capturing images for the next year. Hopefully you will have some deeper appreciation for your neighbor - the tree.
