# Photograph a Tree

Watching a tree is a great thing to do. A tree is probably the most knowledgable living being about the space it lives it. It sits their day in, day out, rain or shine just living its life. It knows when it will rain and when it will snow. You can learn a lot about your home just by observing the trees. But trees are slow. They move slowly over the course weeks, months and years. Adapting themselves to the sun and the wind and the water and the soil as best they can. If you wanted to see a tree on its own timeline, you would need to speed your perception of time up. Fortunately you can do this we a simple smartphone camera and this project is going to help you.

## Pick a Tree
Any will do. Hopefully choose one that you pass by most days. Maybe one close to your home or close to your work. One that you can reliably reach without too much trouble. 

## Pick a Vantage Point
You are going to want to find a place to see the tree. Ideally a spot that is easily recognizeable and doesn't move around too much. Maybe a rock, or a street pole, or even another tree. Find a spot where you can fit the whole tree in the frame of your camera.

## Photographing a Tree
Whenever you pass by this tree try be sure to photograph it. Try to line up your shots so that the tree is always in the same place. The rule of thirds is a good guide.

## Making a Timelapse of your Tree
Now comes the part where I can help you. Collect all of your photos and drag them into the editor. Adjust the setting until it looks right.

## That's All
By now you have probably developed some connection with your tree. You will have seen it change slowly over a season. Maybe you will want to keep going and see what happens over a year. Maybe you will have grown tired. I think that you will probaly appreciate your tree a lot more than when you started.
