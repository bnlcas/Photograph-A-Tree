# Photograph a Tree

Watching a tree is a great thing to do. A tree probably knows more about its small corner of the universe than anyone else knows. It stands there day in, day out, rain or shine for years on end. Observing a tree over the course of a season is a great way to enrich your understanding that space.

This repository contains code for <a href="https://www.photographatree.com">photographatree.com</a> - a website to help you get started photographing a tree. It contains some basic tips on as well as a simple tool to stitch your photo collection together into a timelapse video/gif.

This tool uses [ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm) to convert images into videos.

This project was initially made while at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) Fall 2, 2022.
